								<h2>Experience</h2>
								<h3>Game Developer at Desarrollo Bromio S.C. (2017-Present) </h3>
<!--								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>-->
								<p>I'm Currently working at Bromio as a Game Developer creating and developing IPs as a lead and working on porting projects mainly as a technical artist. 
									As an Indie Lead Game Developer, I have multiple roles, which I choose depending on the project and current milestone.</p>
								<h4>Remnants of The Rift - Game Director / Programmer / 3D Artist / Technical Artist</h4>
								<p>I took the role of Game Director when the project was already in development so my work was to look at the project in its current state and polish and expand most of the existing systems.
									Some of the systems we polished were Mod progression, enemies development, skill rework, progression rework, boss development, lore development, visual development, and combat loop.</p>
								<p>As a programmer and game director I allowed myself to fill the gap that we found in the programming team. I was in charge of polishing, refactoring and 
									creating multiple systems and features such as: Wave controller, enemy behaviors, mod behaviors, skill reworks, and cinematics systems.</p>
								<p>My work as a technical artist consisted on integrating the visuals of the enemies, from the animation to the materials and its particles
									(textures and particles were developed by other team members.)</p>
								<p>As a 3D Artist, I was In charge of modeling the main characters of the game and modeling and animating the enemy creatures of it.</p>
								<h4>Yaopan - Game Director / Programmer / Technical Artist</h4>
								<p> As a Game Director, I was the bridge between the developer team and the researchers team. 
									The client wanted to develop a platformer game in which they wanted to tell the story of "The Conquest of Mexico" and highlight some events. 
									My work consisted of translating the information that the researchers provided to the developing team to implement the visuals and mechanics of the game.</p>
								<h4>Shiba Force - Technical Artist / 3D Artist</h4>
								<p> My task was to create the rigs of the characters so we could swap textures in order to change characters easily and have a single file to animate.</p>
								<h4>Patobox - Technical Artist / 3D Artist</h4>
								<p> This was the first project I worked on. The most part of the development was in charge of creating 3D assets based on the concepts of the team. 
									There was a huge variety of stages that went from a casino to a secret lab.</p>
